/**
 * 3D Model Generation Configuration
 * =================================
 * Mesh generation runs on fal.ai, which DeHub already pays for (FAL_KEY), so
 * this rides the same queue-submit / poll contract the video models use rather
 * than introducing a second provider.
 *
 * Every endpoint id here was read off the fal.ai API docs — they are not
 * interchangeable and the field names differ per family, so the mapping to a
 * request body lives in the generate-3d edge function, not here.
 *
 * ── On `baseCostUsd` ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * fal.ai does not publish a per-generation price on the 3D model pages the way
 * it does for video, so these are deliberately CONSERVATIVE (rounded up)
 * estimates. They set what a creator is charged, at the shared 100% markup, so
 * erring high means the platform is never underwater on a generation. Reconcile
 * them against a real fal.ai invoice after the first week of traffic and adjust
 * — a number that is too high is a pricing decision, a number that is too low
 * is a loss on every mesh.
