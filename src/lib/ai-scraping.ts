 * A creator's AI-scraping preference: whether they want AI systems to train

 *
 * Stored as a flat key in the account `customs` blob (see
 * `common/util/profile-customs.ts` on the backend), which has no
 * server-side merge: a save must read the whole blob, change this one key,
 * and resend everything. There is no migration and no backfill — an account
 * that has never touched this setting has no key at all, and absence means
 * the platform default: allow.
 *
 * This expresses the creator's wishes to crawlers that choose to honour de
 * facto standards (`noai`/`noimageai` robots directives, the TDMRep
 * `tdm-reservation` header/meta). It is carried in page metadata only —
 * never surfaced as profile copy — and it cannot enforce anything against a
 * crawler that ignores those standards; nothing can, short of not
 * publishing at all.
