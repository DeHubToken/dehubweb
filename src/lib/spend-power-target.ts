/**
 * Resolving the target a SuperPower acts on

 * before it offers something, kept out of the component so they can be tested
 * without a React tree, a wallet or a Supabase client.
 *
 * Everything here is advisory. `superpower.service.ts` re-checks each rule and
 * its refusal is the authority; these exist so a person is not offered a
 * choice that is going to be refused, which is the whole complaint the drawer
 * was built to answer.
