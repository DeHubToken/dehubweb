/**
 * Attaching store listings to a post the composer just published
 * ==============================================================
 * The Shop board's listings live in Supabase (`stream_products`) and are
 * written by the `stream-products` edge function, which checks that the caller
 * minted the post and owns the listing. That check needs a tokenId — and the
 * mint is what produces one — so this cannot ride along with the upload the way
 * the affiliate links do. It runs immediately after.
 *
 * Shared by the upload composer and Go Live because the ordering problem and
 * its failure modes are identical on both, and getting one of them subtly wrong
 * would show up as "my products didn't appear" on exactly one surface.
 *
 * **A failure here never fails the post.** The post is already published by the
 * time this runs; throwing would strand a creator on an error screen for
 * something they can fix from the post's edit sheet in two taps. So it returns
 * what it managed and lets the caller say so.

 * Put each listing on the post.

 * a partial unique index and orders rows by `position`, and a burst of
 * concurrent attaches against a row count the function reads first is the shape
 * that produces a duplicate-key error rather than a rail.
 *
 * The first attach is retried, because the ownership check reads the post back
 * from `/api/nft_info/{tokenId}` and that is a different service from the one
 * that just created it. A token that is a second old can read as "not found",
 * which the function correctly answers 404 to — retrying turns a race into a
 * short wait instead of a lost board.
