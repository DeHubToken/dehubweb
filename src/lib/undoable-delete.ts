/**
 * Delete now, commit later.
 *
 * A swipe is too easy to trigger to be final on its own, and a confirm dialog
 * after every swipe undoes the point of swiping. So the row goes at once, an
 * Undo sits in the toast for a few seconds, and only then does the real delete
 * run.
 *
 * Pending ids live at module level rather than in the page's state, so leaving
 * the page inside the window neither loses the delete nor brings the row back
 * on the way in.
