/**
 * Post Reactions
 * ==============
 * Mirror of the API's `config/reactions.ts`. Keep the three copies in sync:
 *   - backend : config/reactions.ts        (source of truth)
 *   - web     : src/lib/reactions.ts       (this file)
 *   - mobile  : libs/reactions.ts
 *
 * WHY REACTIONS AND LIKES COEXIST
 * The API never migrated its boolean vote. Each reaction has a POLARITY, and
 * that polarity is what `totalVotes.for` / `totalVotes.against`, `isLiked` /
 * `isDisliked` and the whole likers list keep counting:
 *
 *   positive → isLiked    (like, love, respect, hot, lol, sad, cry)
 *   negative → isDisliked (dislike, poo)
 *
 * So `likeCount` still means "how many people reacted positively" — it does not
 * become a like-only count when someone loves a post. The per-reaction split
 * lives in `reactionCounts`, which is only used to decide which icon leads.
 *
