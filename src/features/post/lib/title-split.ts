/**
 * Post title split
 * ================
 * A video or audio post written without a title borrows its title from the
 * body text. That borrow used to be a *move*: the text was sliced at 140
 * characters, the slice became the title and the remainder was thrown away —
 * so a clip posted with a 300-character write-up came back with a title cut
 * mid-word and an empty description.
 *
 * This splits instead of slicing. The title still comes off the front, which
 * is the behaviour people want, but everything past the break stays in the
 * description.
 *
 * Break points, in order:
 *
 * 1. **A line break inside the cap.** Somebody who typed a short first line
 *    and then a paragraph has already said where the title ends.
 * 2. **The last space inside the cap**, so a title never stops mid-word.
 * 3. **A hard cut at the cap**, for one unbroken run of characters (a pasted
 *    URL, a script that does not space its words) or a space so early that
 *    honouring it would leave a two-word title in front of a wall of text.
 *
 * Kept in step with mobile's `libs/post-title-split.ts`.
